AlphaCare Insurance Solutions Data Analytics

Project Overview

This repository houses the code and analysis for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on the AlphaCare Insurance Solutions dataset. The objective is to gain insights into various aspects of insurance coverage, claims, and customer demographics.

Data Exploration Steps

    Data Summarization:
        Descriptive statistics are calculated for numerical features (e.g., TotalPremium, TotalClaim) to assess variability.
        Data types of each column are reviewed to ensure proper formatting for categorical variables, dates, etc.
    Data Quality Assessment:
        Missing values are identified and addressed.
    Univariate Analysis:
        Histograms and bar charts are generated to visualize the distribution of numerical and categorical variables, respectively.
    Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:
        Scatter plots and correlation matrices are used to explore relationships between monthly changes in TotalPremium and TotalClaims as a function of ZipCode.
    Data Comparison:
        Trends over geography are analyzed, examining changes in insurance cover type, premium, auto make, etc.
    Outlier Detection:
        Box plots are created to identify outliers in numerical data.
    Visualization:
        Three visually appealing and informative plots are produced to highlight key findings from the EDA.
